This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook implementation of **FTIformer**, including code for **data preprocessing**, **training**, **validation**, and **testing**.  
The notebook also records the recognition results of a private dataset during training, validation, and testing, making it convenient for readers to verify and learn from the workflow.
